# Game
Making a 2d platforming game to keep my development skills sharp as my studies this semester are mostly focused on networking/security stuff. Currently a basic version is working. Need to make some art for it and come up with a story. It's also kind of slow so I will do some optimizations at some point.

To play the game:

```Bash
python3 game.py
```

To run the level editor:

```Bash
python3 gui.py
```
